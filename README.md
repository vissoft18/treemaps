This repository hosts the resources used in the paper *Quantitative Comparison of
Dynamic Treemaps for Software Evolution Visualization*, submited to VISSOFT 2018.

`Datasets` holds the 28 datasets of software development origin that were used for the evaluation of the treemapping techniques. More information about the datasets
can be found in the paper.

Videos of the executions can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy5Y4CMtJ7mJZ29-mKHxHzirsnNZmasT5

Lastly, `Figures` holds all the visualizations generated for all datasets. This includes
all the figures that couldn't make it into the paper for lack of space.
